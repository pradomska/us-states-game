US states quiz
---

I have a turtle screen which has a background that is an image of the US with all of the states blanked out.
And what I'm going to do is by looking at the shape of the map and by remembering what the states look like, 
try to name as many as I can. And once I've entered the name and I hit OK, then if it actually exists, 
it gets added to the map.
